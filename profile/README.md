### Hey, we're James and Danielle, a couple of serial makers

We've been building profitable SaaS products whilst traveling the world for over 10 years!

We took what we learned building with AI, added the best-practices that we've developed over a decade of writing software, and made it into a boilerplate that anyone can use to get started.

- üí¨ 36,000+ people follow us (James/Danielle) building and shipping on Twitter/X.
- üöÄ We've launched 9 products in the last 9 years, most of which ranked in the top #3 for the day, week, and month.
- ‚õµÔ∏è Our profits from our bootstrapped products enabled us to buy a sailboat and keep on shipping from the ocean!
